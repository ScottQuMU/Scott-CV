My name is Xingwei Qu (also known as Scott Qu), and I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, supervised by Prof. Chenghua Lin. My research focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in pretraining, fine-tuning, Mixture of Experts, and System-2 LLMs. I also serve as the Pretrain Leader for the [MAP-NEO](https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/MAP-NEO) project, where I lead efforts on training large multimodal models.

I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from the Technical University of Munich, where I graduated with First-Class Honours under Prof. Dr. Daniel Cremers. I also completed my Bachelor's degree in Automation Science at Beihang University under Prof. Haibin Duan. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Master Thesis Student at Artisense, a Research Engineer at ByteDance Inc., and a Senior Research Engineer at XiaoPeng Inc., where I gained valuable experience in machine learning and AI-driven technologies.
